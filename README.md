Thanks, Customer.Claudette   is also a shareholder of several   companies. Additionally,   she   occasionally   acts   as   an   agent    buying    and    selling   company   shares    on    behalf   of   clients.    One    client,    Dill,    instructs   Claudette   to   invest   in   a   3D   printing   company.   delivery   company   (‘Fastfood   Ltd’).   On   Dill’s   instructions, Claudette buys   10 shares at a price of   1000   RMB   per   share.   Claudette,   sensing   an   opportunity to make money for herself, decides to buy   50 shares   (5%   of the total shares   in the   company) at the same   price with   her   own   funds. The   share   price   begins   to   rise.   However,   the   3D printing company appoint a new director who is   lazy   and   incompetent   resulting   in the   share   price   plummeting.One   of   Claudette’s   other   businesses   is   selling   ice   cream.   She   has   two   small   shops,   each   employing   one   person   and   each   of   the   shop   premises   are   rented.   Staff   costs   are   £100   per   day and daily   rent for each   shop   is   £50.   On   average   each   shop   sells   two   hundred   ice   creams   per day and the cost of   the average ice cream is £3. Claudette has bought an insurance policy,   in her own name, to cover the eventuality of a customer falling   sick from   eating   an   ice   cream   and subsequently making a successful claim in negligence. To make ice   cream   her   shops   use,   a    machine   ‘Creamzze’    specifically    made    for    large    scale    ice    cream    making.      However,    a   ‘Creamzze’   machine   used   in   one   of   her   shops   has   ceased   functioning   due   to   a   mechanical   error.   Claudette   asks   one   of   her   employees,   Daisy, working   at the   ice   cream   shop, to   make   the   ice   cream   by   hand.   Making   ice   cream   by   hand   is   labour   intensive   and   increases   Daisy’s   workload   by   50%. Claudette   promises   Daisy, that   if he   helps   his family can eat   ice   cream for   free   for   an   entire   year.   Daisy   agrees. Aside   from   basic   tips   she   received   at   catering   school,   Daisy’s skill   in   hand   made   ice-cream   is   unproven and she   usually   relied   upon   the ‘Creamzze’   machine to prepare the ice cream. She checks online for further information before   beginning   to   make   the   ice   cream.   Later   that   day   a   customer,   Rose,   falls   ill   after   eating   one   of the   ice   creams   prepared   by   Daisy.   Medical   tests   show   that   this   was   because   of   the   absence   of   stabilizers in the ice cream mixture that remove bacteria. The medical tests   also   demonstrate   that   Rose   had a   pre-existing stomach disorder, which   would   have   made   her   recovery   period   longer.Claudette   is   also the   Chief   Financial   Officer   of a   Company ‘Computers for   Business   Ltd’   . The   company specialises   in developing   price-efficient computing solutions   for   large   corporations.   Claudette   has   been   leading   a   research   team   that   has   developed   a   manufacturing   technique   that   will   allow   the   company   to    produce    computer   components   from    recycled    materials.   However, the board of directors are sceptical about whether this technique will have an impact   on   sales   and   are   concerned   about the   increase   in   product   price that the   new   manufacturing   technique will create. They decide   not to   pursue the venture.   Claudette   is   angry   and   decides to   leave ‘Computers for   Business   Ltd’   and   set   up   her   own   company ‘Recycled   PC   Ltd’   which   utilises    the    new    manufacturing      technique.    The      new      company      is      a      success      and      many   companies place orders immediately. The company’s revenue is estimated to   be   in the   region   of   20M.   It   further   transpires   that   before   Claudette   left   ‘Computers   for   Business   Ltd’   she   authorised company funds to   be transferred to   her nephew who   is   current   studying   abroad.
